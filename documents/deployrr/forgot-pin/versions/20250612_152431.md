# Retrieving a Forgotten PIN

If you've forgotten your Deployrr PIN, you can retrieve or reset it through the About menu. This guide explains both options available to you.

## View PIN (v5.2+)

If you're using Deployrr version 5.2 or later, and your PIN was previously stored locally:

1. Open Deployrr
2. Navigate to the About menu
3. Select "View PIN"
4. Your locally stored PIN will be displayed

## Reset PIN (v5.0+)

If you cannot view your PIN (either because you're using an older version or the PIN wasn't stored locally):

1. Open Deployrr
2. Navigate to the About menu
3. Select "Reset PIN"
4. You will receive an email with a reset link
5. Click the reset link in your email
6. Follow the license verification process from Deployrr About Menu
7. Set up a new PIN when prompted

> ⚠️ **Note**: The email used for the reset process must match the email address associated with your Deployrr license.
