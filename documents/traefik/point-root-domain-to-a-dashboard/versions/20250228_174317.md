# Point Root Domain To A Dashboard

## Date
February 28, 2025

## Overview
This guide explains how to modify your Traefik configuration to point your root domain to a Homelab dashboard (e.g. Organizr, Homepage, Homarr, Dashy, etc.), allowing you to access a dashboard directly from your domain name without needing the subdomain prefix (e.g. organizr.domain.com).

In this document, Organizr is used as example bit it applies any dashboard or even a website. In fact, simplehomelab.com and deployrr.app are both configured this way.

## Original Deployrr Created Configuration
```yaml
http:
  routers:
    organizr-rtr:
      rule: "Host(`organizr.{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`)"
      entryPoints:
        - websecure-external
        - websecure-internal
      middlewares:
        - chain-no-auth
      service: organizr-svc
      tls:
        certResolver: dns-cloudflare
        options: tls-opts@file
services:
  organizr-svc:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: "http://10.0.0.101:83/" # http://IP-ADDRESS:PORT
```

## Solution
To point the root domain (with or without www) to Organizr, you need to modify the router rule to include your base domain. There are several approaches depending on what you want:

### Option 1: Root domain and www subdomain only
```yaml
rule: "Host(`{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`) || Host(`www.{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`)"
```

### Option 2: Keep organizr subdomain and add root domain and www
```yaml
rule: "Host(`organizr.{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`) || Host(`{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`) || Host(`www.{{env "DOMAINNAME_1"}}`)"
```

## Implementation
1. Open your Traefik file provider configuration for Organizr (should be in the rules folder)
2. Locate the router rule section
3. Replace the existing rule with one of the options above
4. Save the file and restart Traefik if necessary
