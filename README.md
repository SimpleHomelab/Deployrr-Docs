## Overview

This repository contains the official documentation for Deployrr, a sophisticated application deployment tool designed to simplify container management and application deployment processes. The documentation is built using WikiDocs and available at [https://docs.deployrr.app](https://docs.deployrr.app).

## Purpose

The Deployrr documentation aims to provide:
- Comprehensive guides for setting up and using Deployrr
- Best practices for container deployment and management
- Technical references for configuration and customization
- Troubleshooting guides and common solutions

## Documentation Structure

The documentation follows a hierarchical structure inside the `documents` folder:

```
documents/
├── category1/
│   ├── document1/
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── versions/
│   └── document2/
│       ├── content.md
│       └── versions/
└── category2/
    └── document3/
        ├── content.md
        └── versions/
```

Each document:
- Lives in its own folder under the appropriate category
- Contains the main content in `content.md`
- May include a `versions` folder containing previous revisions saved by WikiDocs
